      
      The word cloud project will have the following steps:
      
      -  Installed Gutenberg, wordcloud, wordle, matplotlib, pandas
	- From gutenberg.query import get_metadata
	- Import wordcloud, wordle, matplotlib, pandas
	- Import texts from Gutenberg library using gutenberg.query 
	 - Get metadata for 3-5 authors?			 
	- Store the titles for the authors in a dictionary
	- Display the list of authors using iteration
	- Prompt the user to select an author
	- Once the user selects an author, in a for loop, present the user with the titles of      books available for the author from the Gutenberg project.
- The user is asked to select a title by the selected author
- Retrieve the title from project Gutenberg
- Use word cloud module to build a word cloud
- Display the word cloud
- Ask the user if they like to save the word cloud to a file or discard and pick a new author/title.

My current progress is at step 5.
